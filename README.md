DeadTree is a new logic gate simulator written in Java. The original Python files can be found at the [logix page](http://www.github.com/kenzierocks/logix)


But wait! This used to be called **logixsim**!

Yes, it did. However, a quick [google search](https://www.google.com/?q=logixsim#q=logixsim) brings up an actual program! So, since the name has "log" in it ("log"ixsim), and logs are dead trees, this is now **DeadTree**!
